# Color-Detection-OpenCV
Overview
This project is a Color Detection application developed using OpenCV. It allows users to identify and detect various colors in images by processing the pixel values. The application can be used for various purposes, such as image segmentation, object detection, and enhancing user experience in image-based applications.

Features
Real-time Color Detection: Detects colors in images and videos in real-time.
Customizable Color Ranges: Allows users to define and detect specific color ranges using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) format.
Image and Video Support: Works with both image files and live video feed.
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface with adjustable parameters for fine-tuning detection.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Color-Detection-OpenCV.git
cd Color-Detection-OpenCV
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python color_detection.py
Usage
Image Mode: Detect colors in a static image by providing the file path.
Video Mode: Use the webcam to detect colors in real-time.
Example Commands
Detect colors in an image:

bash
Copy code
python color_detection.py --mode image --path ./images/sample.jpg
Detect colors in a video feed:

bash
Copy code
python color_detection.py --mode video
Customization
You can customize the color detection by modifying the HSV range values in the color_detection.py file. Adjust the sliders to experiment with different color ranges for accurate detection.
